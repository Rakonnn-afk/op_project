The Kid Pirates follow a straightforward philosophy: crush anyone who stands in their way. Despite suffering heavy losses in battles against Yonko crews, including Kaido and Shanks, Kid’s ambition to rise to the top of the pirate world remains unshaken. His right-hand man, Killer, is both a loyal friend and deadly combatant known for his dual scythe-blades and fearsome fighting style. Together, the crew is known for their recklessness, pride, and refusal to back down, even against overwhelming odds.</p>
